# Hack112

During the annual hackathon created by the annual 15112 staff, my team and I created Doodle Jump Pro, which mirrored the popular game Doodle Jump. However, it contains new features such as the ability to track your hand motion and play the game with your hands with the assistance of LEAP Motion. The player can also design their own game board, but they also have the option to play the original game.
